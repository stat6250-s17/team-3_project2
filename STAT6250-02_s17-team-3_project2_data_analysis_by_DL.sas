Schools

in the same directory as this file

Question: What are the top ten California High Schools that experienced the
biggest increase in total number of graduates between 2013-2014 and 2014-2015?
Rationale: This would be interesting to find out to see if more students are
graduating from high school as years go by.

Note: This compares the column "Total" from Grads1314to the column of the same 
name from Grads1415.

Methodology: When combining the files Grads1314 and Grads1415 in data
preparation, take the difference of values of the column Total for each school
and create a new variable called Total_Graduates_Rate_Change. After, use proc
sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending order by
Total_Graduates_Rate_Change and then proc print to display the first ten rows
of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: We don't really know if schools kept the same amount of students 
per year. It's possible that a school could have increased the number of
students it instructs which could increase the amount of graduates even if
it's at a lower rate.

Followup Steps: Possibly check if the total number of graduates increased for
the bottom ten schools in terms of total graduates.

Question: What are the top twenty schools with the highest graduation rate?

Rationale: These schools would be interesting to research to see why they have 
the highest graduation rate, and maybe try out some of their teaching 
techniques on other schools that donâ€™t have as high of a graduation rate.

Methodology: Use PROC PRINT to print out the first twenty observations
for the GRADRATE column in the temporary dataset created in the data prep file. 
Then compare the graduation rates.

Limitations: This doesn't take into account total number of students. It's
possible a school could have a low total number of students so it would 
have an better chance of having a higher graduation rate.

Followup Steps: Check the bottom ten schools with the lowest gradution rates.

Question: Which grade has the highest number of dropouts?

Rationale: This is important to know since then we would know which grade to 
target the most with counseling or help from teachers.

Methodology: Use proc means to find the sum for the columnsD9, D10, D11, and 
D12 in the Graduates_analytic_file file created in data.
preparation. Then see which one has the highest number.

Limitations: None

Followup Steps: See which high schools have the highest number of dropouts,
which would demonstrate that these schools maybe need to improve their
teaching/counseling services or something.
